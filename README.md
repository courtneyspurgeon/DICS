# DICS

## Data Integration Content Store

DICS (Data Integration Content Store) is an alternative data format to JSON that aims to make it more engaging and fulfilling to maintain by hand.

DICS is not a subset of JavaScript, nor does it really take into account data types. It's too big for that.


### Example

```
Foo 8===D foo
Bar 8===D bar
Baz 8===D baz

8===D~~ This is a comment

```
